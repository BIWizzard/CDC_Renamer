### Documentation
- ✅ Created README.md with project overview
- ✅ Created production build and distribution guide
- ✅ Created icon creation guide
- ✅ Created this action plan

## Remaining Tasks

### Asset Creation
- [ ] Create Windows icon (icon.ico)
- [ ] Create macOS icon (icon.icns)
- [ ] Create Linux icon (icon.png)
- [ ] Create DMG background for macOS (optional)

### Build & Testing
- [ ] Run a complete production build
- [ ] Test the build on Windows
- [ ] Test the build on macOS (if available)
- [ ] Test the build on Linux (if available)
- [ ] Validate all functionality works in production build

### Packaging & Distribution
- [ ] Configure code signing for Windows (if available)
- [ ] Configure code signing for macOS (if available)
- [ ] Create Windows installer
- [ ] Create macOS DMG
- [ ] Create Linux packages
- [ ] Test installation on all platforms

### Final Touches
- [ ] Update version number before release
- [ ] Perform security audit with npm audit
- [ ] Create release notes
- [ ] Add license file
- [ ] Prepare distribution channels

## Implementation Steps

### Immediate Next Steps (Day 1)
1. Create app icons for all platforms using the icon creation guide
2. Run a complete production build with the new webpack configuration
3. Test the build on the primary development platform

### Short-term Steps (Days 2-3)
1. Configure code signing (if certificates are available)
2. Create installers for all target platforms
3. Test installation and functionality on all platforms

### Final Steps (Day 4)
1. Update version number and create release notes
2. Perform final testing
3. Prepare for distribution

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Path resolution issues in production | Medium | High | Test thoroughly on packaged builds before release |
| PowerShell script execution issues | Medium | High | Ensure scripts work with different execution policies |
| Code signing certificate issues | Medium | Medium | Start the process early, have fallback plan |
| Performance issues on slower machines | Low | Medium | Test on variety of hardware if possible |
| Compatibility issues with different OS versions | Medium | High | Test on multiple OS versions before release |

## Success Criteria

The CDC File Renamer will be considered production-ready when:

1. ✅ All key functionality works correctly in the production build
2. ✅ The application builds and packages successfully for all target platforms
3. ✅ Error handling and logging are robust
4. ✅ Security measures are properly implemented
5. ✅ Documentation is complete for both users and developers
6. ❓ The application has been successfully tested on all target platforms

## Conclusion

The CDC File Renamer is nearly ready for production. By completing the remaining tasks in this action plan, the application will be fully prepared for a professional release.
